<p><font face=calibri>This movie just raises so much in my mind, from paradoxes to what if's??? 
    From the CGI to the Plot everything is just perfect. 
    Hans Zimmer just added the banger to the background hereby creating a Masterpiece.</font></p>

<p><font face=calibri>This movie is the perfect definition of you build a car you gotta need a master to drive it the best. 
    The script, the acting, the cinematography everything is at peak. 7000RPM, perfect shifts, perfect corners 
    and a perfect lap what more do you need???</font></p>

<li><h4>The Dark Knight</h4></li>
<img src="../assets/images/darknknight.jpg" alt="The Dark Knight Poster" width="500" height="600">
<p><font face=calibri>Christopher Nolan knew exactly what he was doing. Creating an Icon.
    Combine that with Christian Bale and here you go, The Dark Knight a.k.a The Batman is here to save Gotham.
 Criminals beware when the Bat-sign comes out watch those asses of yours.</font>
