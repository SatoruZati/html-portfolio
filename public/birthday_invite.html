<ul>
    <li>Gifts (I don't usually get gifts so i would be really happy to get some)</li>
    <br />
    <li>Birthday celebration plans (I don't usually celebrate my birthday 
        nor does anyone else celebrate mine so i'm pretty blank regarding these things)</li>
    <br />
    <li>Cakes and other arrangements(I don't have much expectations about these, 
        but i think it would be great to experience these things with everyone else )</li>
    <br />
    <li>Flowers (I never got flowers so would be pretty nice to get them once before funeral)</li>
    <br />
</ul>
